 <h1>Lucki</h1> 
 <p>Lucki Camel, professionally known as Lucki, is an American rapper and record producer from Chicago, Illinois. He came to public attention in 2013, after receiving rrecognition for his debut project, Alternative rap.

 <p>Lucki went on to eclipse mainstream prominence with the singles "New Drank" and "Super Urus"; The latter served as the lead single to Lucki's second studio album Flawless Like Me (2022), which debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200.

<h2>Top Albums</h2>
<h3>Freewave3</h3>
<p>This is the third tape and first album in LUCKI’s Freewave tape collection. With Freewave 3, LUCKI goes in-depth on his personal struggles and successes with drugs, women, and fake love.

    The album is tied to a year of LUCKI’s life while he had moved from Chicago to NYC to be with a woman.</p>
<h3>Watch My Back</h3>
<p>Watch My Back is Lucki’s fourth project, being a follow-up to days be4 storm.

    The album was first mentioned on December 9, 2016 with the release of the lead single “Options”.</p>
    <h3>Body High</h3>
    <p>This tape shows the progression of Lucki form drug dealer to drug user. Instead of rapping about how he knows the ins and outs of the streets, he decided to go into detail about his personal habits and his growing Xanax habit/addiction. Definitely a more introspective tape.</p>
