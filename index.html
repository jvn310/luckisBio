                The album is tied to a year of LUCKI’s life while he had moved from Chicago to NYC to be with a woman. In an interview with Pitchfork, LUCKI states:
                So the first half of Freewave 3 was recorded while you were in love and the second half while you were heartbroken?
                Yeah, the stuff I say about her on there is so real, bro. I guess the album is really about her. I even say her name in it! And it’s not like I wish it never happened—I made some of my best music from it. It’s funny though, I always used to get in trouble with girls for saying personal shit in the songs they would be like, “What the fuck, that’s OD personal?!”

    <h3>Body High</h3>
    <img src="images/bodyHigh.jpg" class="album-covers" alt="Body High  album cover" style="float: left;">
    This tape shows the progression of Lucki form drug dealer to drug user. Instead of rapping about how he knows the ins and outs of the streets, he decided to go into detail about his personal habits and his growing Xanax habit/addiction. Definitely a more introspective tape.
        <span class="read-more-text">
            The first mention of this album comes along the release of the single “Reflections,” where the tag and description used BODYHIGH.
            On June 13, 2014, the second single “Xan Cage” was released along with a music video.
